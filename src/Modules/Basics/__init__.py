# __init__.py is a special file that tells Python that the directory contains a package,
# so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.
#
# The __init__.py file can contain the same Python code that you would put in a module file.
# __init__.py can also be empty.
#
# You can use it to initialize needed variables or to import specific functions into the package namespace.
